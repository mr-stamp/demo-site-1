    <h2 class="heading">The Hobbit</h2>
    <p>J. R. R. Tolkein's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hobbit" target="_blank">The Hobbit</a> was a masterful journey through an imaginatively realized world, filled with its own history, species, and politics. While a light-hearted tale by its cover, The Hobbit fills the reader with inspiration for even the <em>little man</em> to play a role in <strong>big events</strong>. Tolkein reminds us that, while adventure has its transformative draws, one will always rightly long for the simple comforts in life.</p>

    <h2 class="heading">Animal Farm</h2>
    <p>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Farm" target="_blank">Animal Farm</a> is a novella written by George Orwell, published in 1945. It's a thought-provoking and allegorical tale that uses a group of farm animals to satirize the events leading up to the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the subsequent early years of the Soviet Union. Through its engaging and seemingly simple storyline, Orwell delves deep into the complexities of power, manipulation, and the potential for tyranny in any political system.

    <h2 class="heading">Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass</h2>
    <p>
      The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Frederick_Douglass" target="_blank">Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass</a> was a very good book, touching story. It's for sure one of the best novels I've ever read. It's emotionally engaging and keeps you interested, nevermind the fact that it tells the heartbreaking story of what Frederick and so many other real people actually had to go through. 10/10 would recommend.
